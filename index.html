    <div class="introduction">
        <div class="text">
            <p>I became interested in the field of UX design because of my background in psychology and research. I
                received
                my degree in Psychology and Social Behavior from UC Irvine. I am passionate about applying UX principles
                based in research as well as using user research findings to inform the design of web, and mobile
                applications.
