    <div class="introduction">
        <p>I became interested in the field of UX design because of my background in psychology and research. I received
            my degree in Psychology and Social Behavior from UC Irvine. I am passionate about applying UX principles
            based in research as well as using user research findings to inform the design of web, and mobile
            applications.
